<h5>Introduction:</h5>
<p>HTML is very easy and pretty language where we has to know just about carefully <font color="red">syntax(tag representation),semantics(giving a joint or related information of a tag) and as well as accessibility(making simple to use)</font>to the screen readers or users or assistive devices to have a clear understanding of the elements w.r.t their tags.</p>

<h2>Definition of each tag provided below:</h2>
<p>don't mind that i've started from integer "0"<p><br>
<h4>0.Doctype! html-</h4>
<p>this is the first and foremost tag where the document version can be shown here for example "Doctype! html"=it represents that the writing document should be html5(version of html is 5).where the 5th version is the present updated version with more features.<br>Let's move about further tag.<p><hr>
<h4>1.html-</h4>
<p>yeah! this the second tag of html document where it represents the type of document either html or any other document types basically,from this it confirms that you're writing a html document.</p><hr>
<h4>2.head-</h4>
    <p>it defines that all the "meta"(which type of charset you're using)data,title of the page goes down here in head section.the tag representation          .</p><hr>
<h4>3.title-</h4>
<p>actually i said previously that title belongs to head section that means it should written inside the head itself and this represents your title webpage like you can see my tab name as "html5 version basics"so, it keeps your webpage title.</p><hr>
<h4>4.body-</h4>
<p>right we've come to one other important tag called body tag.
    it defines that all the visible content(what you're seeing on page(visible text,headings,paragraphs,lines,etc....)).</p><hr>
<h4>5.heading tag-</h4>
<p>I think that some people confuse as "head tag=heading tag" but it's completely different where head section refers to meta,title data but heading tag represents the heading of your topic like you can see that 4.heading tag looks big and bold where it represents the heading of particular paragragh or a simple topic right.One more thing that head section writtens at top of html document after html tag where as heading tag writtens inside the "body tag".</p><hr>
<h4>6.paragraph-</h4>
<p>it defines the text that you are writing inside this tag makes it to a paragraph like the data you're seeing after each heading on this page.</pr><hr>
<h4>7.break-</h4>
<p>it defines that you are braking your lines one by one or where ever you want you can use this tag to break the present writing line to next line acc to your interests like you can see all the tag names i've shown at top are not in same line for one tag name one each new line.
<h4>8.horizanatal line</h4>
<p>it breaks the text or paragraph in to two parts by drawing  aline in between them as you can see this page that after every tag definition completion i've shown a horizanatal line where it show's the difference between two paragraphs.</p><hr>
